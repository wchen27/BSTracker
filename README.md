## Overview

Brawl Stars is a mobile game where each user plays a specific character (brawler) and tries to beat their opponents in various game modes in individual matches to gain additional trophies. These matches range from solo game modes to 5v5. Each player’s brawler is able to deal damage to enemy brawlers and score takedowns and assists to help further their team’s progress towards an objective decided by the game mode. The game measures the player’s skill through trophies, where each win will grant the player trophies and each loss will deduct trophies. The player’s brawlers each have their own individual trophy count, as well as a total trophy count for all the brawlers that the player owns. At the end of each match, the player who the game deems the most impactful towards the objective is awarded the title of “Star Player,” with additional titles being granted to the player with the most damage and the most healing. 

This application provides the user with statistics of their recent performance, as well as letting them see the recent performances of other players. These statistics include which brawlers they play, how many games they have played total/with each brawler/on each map, how many trophies they have in total and how many trophies each individual brawler they own has, and their win/lose rate overall, on each map, and on each brawler. 
Additionally, this app calculates a “performance score” between 1-100 for each user for each individual game, assessing the impact that player had during that game. Finally, this application lets the user review the statistics of past matches that are available and see which brawler they were playing, if they won, their opponents/teammates, and their overall performance score during that game. 

## Team Story: 

There is a brawl stars esports team named Team Bottle. They are trying to prepare for their next match against another esports team and want to try and know how to improve and the weaknesses of the other team. To improve, they want to know if they win or lose more with certain brawlers or maps, know their overall performance with certain brawlers and maps, and the trophies on the individual brawlers. This would allow them to know more about which maps and brawlers to focus on or maybe those that are not worth investing time in. To know the weaknesses of the other team, they need to be able to see the win rate for certain brawlers of other users, how often the other team uses certain brawlers, and how well they are doing on certain maps and brawlers. This would allow them to know who to focus on practicing against and maybe which brawler and map to ban in the next game.

### Wilson: 
Mitchy is a casual Brawl Stars player, preferring to play with his friends once or twice a day. One day, Mitchy decides that his skill level is way above those of his friends, and that his friends are holding him back from becoming more skilled at the game. In order to confirm these beliefs, Mitchy decides to use the app’s performance score feature to compare his recent performance with those of his friends. Upon realizing that his performance score is significantly higher every game than those of his friends, he realizes that he is much more prodigious at the game than they are, and decides to spend more time playing the game alone. Using the information from the app, Mitchy quickly climbs the ranks and becomes a high-level player. 

### Justin: 
I would like to gain trophies as efficiently as possible, so I am looking to play brawlers that have an advantage over their counterparts. To find such popular brawlers, I will look at the recent matches played by players at the top of the world leaderboards.
I want to:
Retrieve a list of the most popular brawlers played in recent games
View relevant statistics (average damage, knockouts, etc. per game) and compare it with my performance
Save this tracking list to compare my change in performance from the last time I updated the statistics

### Thomas:
Grom has been playing Brawl Stars a little too much recently and he wants to finally go pro. To do this he decided to finally look at his stats to see which brawlers he should focus on getting better at and those that he is a little weaker at. However, since he has so many brawlers at the same trophy count, he wants to be able to see a different metric that shows his skill with different brawlers, like a performance rating. Additionally, he would like to see which maps he loses or wins more at so that he can practice those specific maps and get better at them. Finally, he also wants to be able to see how his teammates and the friends he was playing with did so that he can know whether he is getting too much help from his teammates.

### Zehao: 
I am a new/beginner Brawl Stars player who is curious about the game. As an introduction, I want to understand how my friends play – what brawlers do they play with most frequently? What maps? What combinations/game modes result in optimal performance? By reviewing my friends’ game statistics, I can identify who is genuinely a good player and analyze their gameplay patterns. As I improve, I can also review the changes in my performance statistics to track what I am getting better/worse at. Additionally, I want to find teams with a skill level similar to mine that I may want to monitor or join.

### Lawrence:
As a competitive Brawl Stars player, I want to analyze my gameplay and compare it with top players, so I can understand my strengths and weaknesses across different brawlers, maps, and game modes. I also want insights into the performance of my friends and teammates to evaluate if our playstyles align or if adjustments are needed to improve our synergy. Lastly, I want to track my own skill progression over time to see my improvement in various game metrics, such as damage dealt, knockouts, and win rates, which will help me make strategic decisions on which brawlers and strategies to focus on.
